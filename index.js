/*Task 1: counterMaker()
  
  Study the code for counter1 and counter2, then answer the questions below.
  
  1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
      counter1 function is a closure, like a mini computer that remember count variable as its internal variable
      counter2 function is a function that reach out to get counter variable through mechanism of closure.
  
  2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
      counter1 function is aclosure since it store counter variable as its internal state.
  
  3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would counter2 be better?
      counter1 code is better for isolated virtual mini computer, like VM.
      counter2 code is better for general purpose function and reusable code.
